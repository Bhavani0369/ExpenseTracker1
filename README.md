ExpenseTracker
The Expense Tracker project aims to provide users with a convenient way to track their expenses. The project addresses the common problem of individuals and businesses needing to monitor and manage their spending habits. By developing an expense tracking application, users can easily record and analyse their expenses, helping them make informed financial decisions.


Event Listeners: 
The script listens for various user interactions, including form submissions, expense editing, deletion, and category filtering.


Adding Expenses: 
When the user submits the form, the new expense (with name, amount, category, and date) is added to an array and displayed in a list.


Expense Display: 
The displayExpenses function dynamically creates and updates the HTML table with the expense details.


Editing & Deleting: Users can edit or delete an expense. Editing allows pre-filled values to be adjusted, while deleting removes the expense from the list.


Filtering by Category: Users can filter the expense list based on the selected category.


Total Calculation: The total amount of all expenses is calculated and displayed whenever changes occur.


This script provides basic expense management functionality with features for adding, viewing, filtering, editing, and deleting expenses.
